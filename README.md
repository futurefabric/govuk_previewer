GOVUK Previewer
===============

This is meant to live on a glanceable monitor.

It is a means to preview different page formats on [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk) so that if there are any 
layout issues, they can be caught before deployment.

There are examples of lots of different formats across [GOV.UK](https://gov.uk).


How to use
----------

Go to [govuk-previewer.herokuapp.com](http://govuk-previewer.herokuapp.com/)

Open each of the example formats in a new browser tab.

If using Chrome browser (recommended), use this in conjunction with two Chrome plugins: [Revolver](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda?hl=en) and [Auto Refresh Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh-plus/oilipfekkmncanaajkapbpancpelijih?hl=en) which will allow 
for automatic tab rotation and refreshing at a specified interval.

([One Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) is also handy for saving/restoring these tabs if needed.)
