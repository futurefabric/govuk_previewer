GOVUK Previewer
===============

This is meant to live on a glanceable monitor.

It is a means to preview different page formats on GOV.UK so that if there are any 
layout issues, they can be caught before deployment.

There are examples of lots of different formats across GOV.UK.


How to use
----------

Go to [govuk-previewer.herokuapp.com](http://govuk-previewer.herokuapp.com/)

Open each of the example formats in a new browser tab.

If using Chrome browser (recommended), use this in conjunction with two Chrome plugins: [Revolver](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revolver-tabs/dlknooajieciikpedpldejhhijacnbda?hl=en) and [Auto Refresh Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-refresh-plus/oilipfekkmncanaajkapbpancpelijih?hl=en) which will allow 
for automatic tab rotation and refreshing at a specified interval.

[One Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall?hl=en) is also handy for saving/restoring these tabs if needed.
